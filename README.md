# First-Android-App

Recently received the Grow with Google Challenge Scholarship. 
Had to do numerous lessons on the basics of android and at the end build a quiz app that used
radio buttons, check boxes, edit text views, nested viewgroups, etc.

I made this app consisting of 5 questions with questions from my old C++ programming II
test.
